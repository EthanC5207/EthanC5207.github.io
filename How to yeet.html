		<h2>Understanding the definition</h2>
		<p>Yeet is an interesting word, as it has no real definition. The only way to understand it is by seeing a lot of context. Because of that, I have provided a bunch of sentences to help you understand:</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">I'm finna yeet</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">They yeeted on me</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">I yeeted on them</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">They yeeted the eraser at the teacher</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">The yeet level is over 9000</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">The yeet level is <i>actually</i> over 9000</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px">The yeet level is <i>literally</i>, over 9000</p>
		<h2>Using it in sentences</h2>
		<p>Now that you have gotten an understanding of the uses of the word, try to use it in sentences! An exampe of this would be rewording <q>they threw the ball</q> into <q>they yeeted the ball</q>. Give it a try! Bye bye now!</p>
